The only important file for this assignment is the ipython notebook. 
All responses are in there.

The goal of the assignment was to give a treatment on linear regression,
paying attention to programming linear progression using scikit.learn
in Python.

One topic paid extra attention was the notion of L1/L2 regularization.
